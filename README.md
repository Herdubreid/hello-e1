## Getting started with E1
A simple but fully fledged mobile E1 app build with the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) that can be used as a starting point for new E1 app development.  
The key `Hello E1` features are:

    - A basic Ionic framework with paging menu
    
    - The plumbings required for [Redux](http://redux.js.org) and [e1-service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/e1-service)
    - An About page that tests and stores the AIS url and optionally default user name and password
    - An A/B Word Search page that demonstrates search & select requests
    - An A/B Revision page that demonstrate inspect requests (read-only)

### Prerequisite
First, have the latest recommended versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.

Install Ionic with:

```bash
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```
